### **1. Data Scalability**
**What**: Data scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle increasing amounts of data or requests by efficiently managing resources. It involves scaling up or out to meet growing demands.

**When**: It becomes critical when a system experiences increased data volume or user activity, often triggered by user growth, data collection, or operational needs.

**Where**: Used in systems like databases, cloud services, and distributed systems that handle large amounts of data.

**Why**: To ensure that a system can continue to perform well as data grows, supporting performance, availability, and response time.

**How**: Achieved through **vertical scaling** (adding more power to a single machine) or **horizontal scaling** (adding more machines/nodes). Use of distributed databases, partitioning, and sharding is common.

**Application**: Cloud-based systems, e-commerce platforms, IoT applications, big data systems.

**Advantages**: 
- Ensures smooth operation even as data volume increases.
